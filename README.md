# Ubuntu Development Setup Script

Automatically setup Ubuntu for development in under 5 minutes.

## Dot-files and automatic configs

As off now, the script does not provide default configurations and all the dot-files should be uploaded to GitHub Gists and made public. **When prompted to type your GitHub username, use the account you uploaded the Gists under** so the script can find your config.

You should have these files uploaded to GitHub Gists:

- `.gitconfig`
- `.zshrc`
